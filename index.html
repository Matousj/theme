        The piece of technology that promotes learning is a laptop.
        Collaboration may be encouraged via educational technologies. Students
        can interact with one another throughout lessons in addition to engaging
        with teachers. Students have the opportunity to collaborate to solve
        challenges through online classes and educational activities. Students
        can encourage one another and exchange ideas through collaborative
        activities (Henriksen 411). Technology also makes it possible for
        students to engage directly with professors. Students can seek more
        assistance on concepts that are challenging to comprehend as well as ask
        questions about the classroom (Lai and Bower 30). Students may upload
        their schoolwork at home, and teachers can use computers to access and
        view completed assignments. Moreover, teachers may encourage childrenâ€™s
        curiosity and inquisitiveness through entertaining and instructive
        material, which, according to studies, is linked to academic
        performance. Students that are curious learn math and reading subjects
        more effectively. AR, videos, and podcasts may all be used to create
        compelling content. Students can also engage with peers from across the
        world or add films in their work.
